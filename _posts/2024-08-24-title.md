# Welcome to my blog!

I figured out how to set this thing up finally. Ruby is NOT COOL. The guide said "do this stuff" so that is what I did and then we had some technical difficulties which we were able to surmount with some google-fu. 
My compliments to the users at https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/newbie-problems-with-wdm-errors/9233/2 because without them I would still languish in the hell that the guide sought for me to reside in. Ruby is perhaps closer to a Garnet in the value of its documentation.

Moving on, this blog sort of reminds me of the blog I used to read written by my German pen-pal from way back in the day, Mery. She had a wordpress set up. I still have some of my old letters from her. She gave me a piece of the Berlin Wall! Geil!

Alright this is literally all I'm going to say for this round. I'm just glad I made it this far in spite of whoever! Look forward to updates about life or just general ranting or my experience and blah blah blah.
