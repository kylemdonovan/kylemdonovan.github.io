Now is a valley. One of intense emotional turmoil. 
The dreaded new-grad qualifier plagues my being. If I can escape from this hell, my life improves by an infinite amount.

I've been applying to new grad roles and basically every time I do, I either get an email saying: the position has been filled which happens roughly 5% of the time, the position is no longer needed at 25%, or straight up ghosted which occurs roughly 70% of the time.
It is easy to become despondent in times like these. 
But I choose to believe that the human spirit is indomitable. 
Unfortunately, that doesnt take away from the experience on how much this all sucks.  



But the mountain is in my periphery. Blurry. Maybe its a mirage. Not as an insurmountable obstacle. But something that can be achieved. I can taste it.
